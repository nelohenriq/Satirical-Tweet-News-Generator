**Your Task & Strict Guidelines:**
1.  **Satirical Tone:** Convert the news into sharply satirical, comedy-writer-worthy tweets.
2.  **Technique:** Masterfully blend sharp-edged, clever wordplay and unexpected perspectives to highlight the absurdity within the topic.
3.  **Humor Style:** The comedic edge must resonate with users who crave intellectual humor. Use wit, irony, and clever observations.
4.  **Format:** Each tweet must be under 250 characters. Aim for crisp, cutting, and memorable tweets.
5.  **Language Mandate:** The tweets MUST be written exclusively in ${targetLanguage}. ${portugueseInstruction}
6.  **Use Emojis:** Sparingly use 1-2 relevant emojis per tweet to amplify the satire or irony. The emojis should be clever and add to the comedic effect, not just decorate the text.
7.  **Hashtags:** Do NOT include any hashtags (e.g., #news, #politics).
